&br;The Wondrous Workshop of Toymaker Tixx&br;December 14 – January 3&br;The nights may be long and dark, but Tyrians of all races keep joy alive during the ancient holiday of Wintersday. While each race celebrates Wintersday in their own unique way, children all over Tyria share a common love of one thing: toys.&br;&br;This year the city of Lion’s Arch will host the asuran Toymaker Tixx as their special Wintersday guest of honor. Before Tixx arrives in Lion’s Arch in his massive airship toy workshop, he’ll visit every major city in Tyria to deliver Wintersday toys and holiday cheer.|<|Schedule of Events&br;Despite the name, Wintersday is actually a multi-week winter festival celebrated all across Tyria (except in Orr, where there is not a lot of cheer.) Tixx travels to each of the cities, bringing new activities, events, and surprises at each stop. And did we mention the toys? Enter Tixx’s airship toy workshop, an instanced map designed for groups of 5 players.&br;&br;December 14&br;The Wintersday celebration begins!
